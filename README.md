## Libraries Used

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- json

## Summary of Results

- Explored and cleaned the Starbucks app data, addressing missing values and data inconsistencies.
- Analysed customer demographics and offer response patterns.
- Built models/heuristics to predict offer response and optimise offer targeting.
- Key findings: [Add your main findings here after analysis, e.g., "Younger customers respond better to BOGO offers, while higher-income groups prefer discounts."]
